**TIC-128 TINY COMPUTER** - [https://tic.computer/](https://tic.computer/)

# About
TIC-128 is a version of the **FREE** and **OPEN SOURCE** TIC-80 fantasy computer for making, playing and sharing tiny games.
Think of TIC-128 being a version of TIC-80 that has more RAM and supports bigger screens. Of course it was exclusively released in Japan back in the 80's ;P

Just like with TIC-80, you get built-in tools for development: code, sprites, maps, sound editors and the command line in a version adpted to a default screen size of 384x128.
For documentation, check out the original TIC-80 website.
